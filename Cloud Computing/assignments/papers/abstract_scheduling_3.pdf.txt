CloudScale is a system, whic dynamically scales resources in multi-tenant cloud computing infrastructure. It calculates a resource usage prediction for every tenant and dynamically scales resources to minimize SLO (Service Level Objective) violation penalties. If a SLO is not met, CloudScale adapts to the under-estimation of required resources by slowly alloting additional resources to the tenant. This happens according to a dynamic value ALPHA. Cloudscale uses an adaptive padding mechanism to minimize the effect of resource usage bursts. It gives every tenant an extra amount of available resources, according to recent resource usage patterns. Lastly it also encompases a system to migrate tenants to different machines. To do this yet another predictive mechanism is put in place, which uses the resource usage prediction and also tries to minimize SLO violation penalties. WHAT DO THE TESTS LOOK LIKE?
