\section{Problem}
Exisitng Framorks are statically allocating resources to jobs\\
-> cant maintain SLOs while maintaining full utilization and efficiency\\
- 1 solution killing tasks -> high overheads\\
- 1 solution only use 70\% of resources\\
------Utilizaztion: using all resources; Efficiency: not rdoing tasks\\

\section{not working solutions}
make task size smaller -> more disk seeks and more overhead at scheduler\\
uniform size tasks -> doesnt work because $\frac{input amount}{task time}$ is not consistent\\
OS checkpoints, suspend and save state in memory -> too much space needed, HDD no option too slow etc.\\

\section{Solution}
Amoeba - Prototype\\
Smallest granularity is task -> make it more granular -> split up tasks\\
Mapper gets set of records as input (a list of words); every possible sublist is a admissable partitioning of the data (the blocks to work on can consist of any number of words); you can kill a task after every record and pretend you made the blocks that way
A Checkpoint is the nest key where to continue
