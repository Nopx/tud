{\huge Data Centers \& Efficiency\\}
\section{Datacenter:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item Are the backbone of many computer systems
\item Have long racks in mysterious buildings
\item business technology uses them widely
\item REASON: Hight compute power for little price (Economy of Scale)
\item REASON: Data is in one spot to make things easier
\item REASON: System has a consistent bandwidth
\item REASON: In total easier support of demanding applications
\end{itemize}
A typical firt year of a {\bf DC} consists of many failures (overheating, rack failure, rack movement,...)

\subsection{Costs}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item Servers (CPU, Memory / Storage)
\item Infrastructure (Power distribution and cooling)
\item Power (Electrical utility costs)
\item Network (Links, transit and equipment)
\item Server costs are the highest
\item Datacenters usually have low utilization (10-30\%). Because:\\
	-They are not agile and not every server can do every task\\
	-Peak load has to be managable\\
	-This is normal though with many things not only DC (Highways have low utilization aswell)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item Storage: Distributed filesystem or network attached storage
\item Network: Very important and usually 1-10 GB/s
\item Programmability: What encompases the Map Reduce Programming model? We need appropriate abstractions
\end{itemize}

\section{DC Networks \& Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item Need for uniform high capacity (no need to consider topology when adding servers)
\item Network traffic of one service should be unaffected by other service (Performance Isolation)
\item Any Server ca have any IP Address for better agility

\item Applications get addressed directly
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item Applications get addressed directly
\item There are {\bf A}pplication {\bf A}ddresses and {\bf L}ocation {\bf A}ddresses
\item Most traffic is in the intranet
\item Apps should not disturb each other (fairness and isolation)
\end{itemize}

\section{Energy Efficiency}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-4pt}
\item Computers use 2\% of worlds energy
\item PUE = Power Usage Effectiveness
\item Energy should be little and proportional to work
\item How?\\
	-match work to power or power to work
	-send power to other systems
	-make disks spin slower or so
\end{itemize}
