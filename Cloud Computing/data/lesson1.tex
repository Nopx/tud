\section{What do we want to do?}
	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
	\item make data access \& processing a fundamental right
	\item do big science
	\item do it energy efficient
	\item do it scalable and efficiently
	\item automate everything (press 1 big red button that does whatever you want)
	\item adapt to new HW and SW
	\item {\bf manage dynamic changes in resource need}
	\item do it all in bounds of cost, energy and reliability
	\end{itemize}
\section{What is Cloud Computing?}
	There are certain US norms for differend types of applications
	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
	\item {\bf IaaS} Infrastructure as a Service\\
		You sell resources
	\item {\bf PaaS} Platform as a Service\\
		You sell for example tables or a website
	\item {\bf SaaS} Software as a Service\\
		You sell some usable software (Spotify, Facebook, etc.)
	\end{itemize}
	We will focus on {\bf IaaS} because PaaS and SaaS just build on top of that.

\section{IaaS properties}
	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
	\item On demand / Pay per use of resources 
	\item Elasticity\\ {\it the resources available can row and shrink according to demand}
	\item Resource pooling \\{\it multiple people share the same resources}
	\item Full automation \\{\it is the dream}
	\item Quality \\{\it is important}
	\end{itemize}
	
	Maybe continue this?
