The term "Timing of opportunity" refers to the time during which it is worthwhile to pursue a certain opportunity. The entrepreneur can miss this window of opportunity by coming too late or too early. If for example he enters a market before people realize the need for his product, he came too early. If somebody would want to sell a mobile phone without touchscreen, he would most likely come too late, since the market here is already more advanced.
To extend his window of opportunity, the entrepreneur has to develop something that meets one of the so called VRIN conditions. VRIN stands for Value, Rare, Inimitable, Non-substitutable. 
The entrepreneur can have something with a significant Value to the customer. In the phone example that could be, that the phone can not break. 
The entrepreneur could exploit a situation in which what he sells is not easily available (Rare). In the phone example this would happen, if for some reason many existing phones vanish together with their producers.
The entrepreneur could create something which is Inimitable. This can easily be achieved by branding a product.
The entrepreneur could make sure that his product is unique (Non-substitutable). In the phone example the value of the phone rises, if there is no other unbreakable phone.
