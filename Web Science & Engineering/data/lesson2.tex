\section{Vision}
	\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
	\item Web Science is the new way of Computer Science
	\item Web Science is the science of decentralized Information Systems
	\item CS perspective contains a lot of technology \\ {\bf But socially embedded}
	\item Web Science novelty: \\1.What do people want?\\2.HCI in middle
	\item Web Science also focuses on negative aspects (Data breaches, Phishing, Hacking)
	\item We need to have metrics for different things, which are not easily defined
	\end{itemize}
	Our aim is to generate {\bf descriptive} theories to generate {\bf prescriptive} models.\\
	{\bf descriptive} so that we understand what's going on and so that we can reason about it.\\
	{\bf prescriptive} so that we can easily prescribe it for use

\section{Paper rough guide}
	A paper needs a {\bf motivation} and a {\bf goal}\\
	There are 3 steps for making a paper:\\
	\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
	\item make theory
	\item make model
	\item verify
	\end{enumerate}
	The mainly important points to this are, that you need to convince the reader about your idea and
	that you need to make your idea challengable\\
	You need to start with a theory and then check it. If a new theory comes up check it afterwards.
	
	\subsection{Research question}
		\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
		\item You need to understand it
		\item keep it in the CS field
		\item the quetion needs to be understood as a standalone question (not "How does the System 
		work?")
		\item make it relevant $\xrightarrow[]{}$ contribute something
		\item ask if it is doable (by you)? and if it is relevant?
		\item can someone else do it? 
		\item what resources are available?
		\item In this course confine to web science problems
		\end{itemize}
